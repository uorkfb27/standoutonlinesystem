# Stand Out Online System Review: Get in Front of 1M+ Women Entrepreneurs, Skip the Ads

You know that feeling when you've been posting on social media for months and it feels like you're basically talking to yourself and three bots? Yeah. That's the nightmare most women entrepreneurs are living in right now. The algorithm is a disaster, paid ads cost a fortune, and building an audience from scratch feels like trying to fill a bathtub with a teaspoon.

So when I heard about the **Stand Out Online System** — a membership that essentially lets you *borrow* an already-built audience of over a million women — I had to dig in and figure out if it's actually legit or just another overhyped marketing pitch.

Spoiler: it's more real than I expected.

## What Is Stand Out Online System, Exactly?

It's a monthly membership program created by **Christina Forbes**, founder of Stand Out Media Group. The core idea is influencer marketing — but instead of paying some influencer you've never met to awkwardly mention your product, you get *direct* promotional access inside a massive, highly engaged Facebook community: **Women Helping Women Entrepreneurs**, which currently sits at 923,000+ members and grows by hundreds every single day.

That's not a typo. Nearly a million women, most of whom are actively running or building businesses, are in this group right now.

Here's where it gets interesting. This isn't just a "post in our group" deal. The membership bundles together a bunch of promotional touchpoints:

- **Promotional posts** — Regular members post 2 promo posts weekly; VIP members post 5.
- **Newsletter feature** — Your free gift offer (think lead magnet) gets shared to build your email list.
- **Monthly Business Spotlight** — A dedicated post about your business, shared across 923K+ group members AND Christina's 250K+ social media followers.
- **Business Directory listing** — Permanent presence in the Women Helping Women Business Directory.
- **Podcast feature** — A monthly featured episode on the Women Helping Women Entrepreneurs Podcast.

## Pricing: What Does It Cost?

There are two tiers — Regular and VIP — each with monthly or annual billing options.

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price | Go Lives/Week | Promo Posts/Week |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Regular Member** | $197/month | $970/year | 2x | 2 posts |
| **VIP Member** | $297/month | $2,997/year | 5x | 5 posts |

The annual plans save you roughly 2 months compared to paying monthly. If you're planning to stay in for the long haul (and most members do, based on the testimonials), the annual option is the smarter play.

## Who Is This Actually For?

This membership is laser-targeted. It works if you are:

- A **woman entrepreneur** selling services, coaching, courses, or products
- Someone whose ideal client is **another woman in business**
- Tired of paying for ads that drain your budget and produce inconsistent results
- Ready to be seen as an authority, not just another person posting into the void

It's probably *not* for you if your target market is, say, teenage gamers or B2B enterprise software buyers. The audience is very specifically women entrepreneurs — which is either a perfect fit or a complete mismatch depending on who you serve.

## Does It Actually Work?

The page is loaded with member testimonials and ROI screenshots — email list growth, leads flooding in, sales from a single promotional post. Now, results vary (as any disclaimer will tell you), and your success depends heavily on the quality of what you're posting and how well your offer resonates with this audience.

But the math isn't complicated: if your offer connects with even a fraction of a million engaged women, you don't need a huge conversion rate to see meaningful results. The platform is just *access* — what you do with it is on you.

## The One Thing Worth Knowing About Cancellation

This is important and easy to miss. You must **submit a cancellation form at least 7 days before your next billing date** if you want to cancel. Miss that window and you get billed for another month. Set a calendar reminder the day you sign up. Don't learn this one the hard way.

## Bottom Line

If your ideal client is a woman running or building a business online, and you've been grinding away trying to grow an audience from zero while paying for ads that barely break even — the Stand Out Online System is genuinely worth looking at. The access to nearly a million warm, buyer-ready people in one community is rare. You're essentially renting a megaphone that took years to build.

The $197/month entry point isn't cheap, but neither is $1,000/month in Facebook ads that nobody clicks.
